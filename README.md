Our cient Creative Technology Solutions requested that we build a web-based game that will support multiple platforms. During the documentation of this program what I did particulary well is researching information about each platform. One thing I would improve about my code is adding the correct functions to the code. In terms of the user's needs  I looked at the list of needs requested and looked for information ways to accomplish them, taking into account the cost efficiency and user friendliness.My approach was to look at the files and check for errors. Once I checked for errors, I made sure the software would run.
